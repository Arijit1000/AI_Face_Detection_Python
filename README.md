**Face Detection with Python using OpenCV**

Face detection is a computer technology that determines the
locations and sizes of human faces in arbitrary (digital)
images. It detects facial features and ignores anything else,
such as buildings, trees and bodies. Human face perception is
currently an active research area in the computer vision
community. Human face localization and detection is often the
first step in applications such as video surveillance, human
computer interface, face recognition and image database
management. Locating and tracking human faces is a
prerequisite for face recognition and/or facial expressions
analysis, although it is often assumed that a normalized face
image is available.In this paper we intend to implement the
Haar-Classifier for Face detection and tracking based on the
HaarFeatures.
